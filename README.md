# British_Airways_virtual_Internship
This repository contains the tasks I completed as part of my virtual internship with British Airways through the Forage platform.
The virtual internship involves two key tasks: first, conducting web scraping to collect valuable insights about companies, and second, predicting customer buying behavior. As part of this internship:
ðŸ”¹Completed a simulation focussing on how data science is a critical component of British Airways success
ðŸ”¹Scraped and analyzed customer review data to uncover findings
ðŸ”¹Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behavior
